## ðŸš€ What I Accomplished

Getting this app from concept to deployment involved several key steps:

* **App Development:** I built the core application using Python, Streamlit, and Pandas, enabling file uploads, dynamic pivot table creation, and data aggregation.
* **Version Control:** I set up and managed the project using Git, committing changes and hosting the code on GitHub ([`thomaglads/pivot-table-app`](https://github.com/thomaglads/pivot-table-app)).
* **Successful Deployment:** I successfully deployed the application to Streamlit Cloud, overcoming challenges like ensuring the Python script was correctly formatted (free of Jupyter Notebook metadata) and handling Git synchronization for a smooth launch.
